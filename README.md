# Stampede-Alert-System
Stampedes can cause loss of life in public places like pilgrimage place or a Bridge. This is caused by large crowd density. This project ensures that for a given area of a place, the crowd density remains under a safe bound of 5 sq feet per person(data taken from Phelps 2017) and helps in stampede prevention.
